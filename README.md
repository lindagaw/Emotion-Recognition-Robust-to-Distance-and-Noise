# Galatea

Pygmalion saw women waste their lives

in wretched shame, and critical of faults

which nature had so deeply planted through

their female hearts, he lived in preference,

for many years unmarried.--But while he

was single, with consummate skill, he carved

a statue out of snow-white ivory,

and gave to it exquisite beauty, which

no woman of the world has ever equalled:

she was so beautiful, he fell in love

with his creation. It appeared in truth

a perfect virgin with the grace of life,

but in the expression of such modesty

all motion was restrained--and so his art

concealed his art. Pygmalion gazed, inflamed

with love and admiration for the form,

in semblance of a woman, he had carved.
